# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Docs! This folder serves as a centralized starting point for understanding how OctoAcme runs projects, from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement. Whether you're a new team member or looking to refresh your understanding of our processes, these documents provide the foundational knowledge needed to navigate OctoAcme's project management best practices.

## About OctoAcme's Project Management Approach

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative delivery model designed to maximize value while maintaining quality and transparency. Our project management framework is built on five core principles: prioritizing customer value and usability, delivering small testable increments, ensuring clear ownership through named Project Managers and Product Leads, making data-informed decisions based on measurable impact, and fostering psychological safety that encourages feedback and learning. This approach enables cross-functional teams to deliver product features, services, and integrations efficiently while maintaining alignment across stakeholders.

Our project lifecycle follows a structured yet flexible path from initiation through closure. Projects begin with a lightweight initiation phase that validates business needs, identifies stakeholders, and establishes clear success metrics through a Project One-pager. Planning transforms approved initiatives into actionable backlogs with defined acceptance criteria, estimates, and release timelines. During execution, teams follow a consistent rhythm of daily standups, weekly syncs, and sprint demos while tracking progress through project boards and maintaining quality through comprehensive testing. Releases follow standardized procedures with pre-deployment checks, smoke tests, and rollback plans to minimize risk. Each project concludes with retrospectives that capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements for future work.

The framework defines clear roles and responsibilities across the delivery team. Project Managers coordinate delivery activities, manage schedules and risks, and maintain stakeholder communication. Product Managers define what should be built, prioritize the roadmap, and measure outcomes against success metrics. Developers implement features, write tests, and participate in design decisions. QA and testing specialists validate quality and acceptance criteria. Throughout the project lifecycle, effective communication occurs through weekly PM and Product Manager syncs, twice-weekly standups, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalations as needed. This structured communication ensures alignment while providing the flexibility to address emerging needs.

Quality assurance is woven throughout our processes rather than relegated to a final phase. Teams maintain comprehensive test coverage including unit tests for new logic, integration tests for system components, and end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows. Pull requests follow strict workflows with automated testing, security scanning, and peer review before merging. Risk management is proactive rather than reactive, with teams maintaining risk registers that track identification, assessment, mitigation, and monitoring of potential issues. This disciplined approach to quality, combined with our emphasis on psychological safety and continuous improvement, enables teams to deliver reliable software while maintaining sustainable development velocity.
